**Validator rejects some code from plugins as invalid. I have errors on all my pages that all come from the code my plugins want me to use. i.e. For  the jssor plugin, I use <img u="image" src="img/glassware.jpg" />.The validator won't accept the "u" as correct but when I tried changing to a class in my code it won't work. I tried searching in that plugin's js file for that "u" and I can't figure out where it comes from. 

The fancy plugin does something similar: "rejects the value group for attribute reel on element a: The string is not a registered keyword" for the following on my gallery page:
Ép" href="img/galleria/tarte-tatin.jpg"><img src="img/galleria/tarte-tatin.jpg"É

Lastly, the validator rejects google's font compilation.
